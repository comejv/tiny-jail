# Rust based seccomp sandbox

This project focuses on developing a command-line utility in Rust designed to enhance system security by sandboxing applications using Linux's `seccomp-bpf` mechanism. The core idea is to provide a tool that allows specifying system call policies, thereby reducing the kernel attack surface available to a target program. Inspired by tools like `Firejail` and `Bubblewrap` in their `seccomp` capabilities.

The implementation will leverage Rust's memory safety and low-level control features to safely interact with the operating system. Key components will include the `nix` Rust crate for essential Unix system calls (such as process management via `fork` and `execve`) and the `libseccomp` rust crate to build and load filters in the kernel. Policies will be defined in an external, human-readable format (e.g., TOML or YAML), allowing users to specify permitted, denied, or error-returning system calls, and potentially specific argument constraints.

A significant extension for this project would involve integrating dynamic analysis capabilities: using tools like `strace` or `perf trace` to observe the system calls made by an application during its typical operation, thus aiding in the generation and refinement of effective `seccomp` policies.
